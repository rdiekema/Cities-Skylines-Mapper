# Cities OSM

Import roads from real world road maps using data from the [Open Street Map Foundation.](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page)

#### Throughput
Please be curteous about your request volume, the API endpoints are provided free of charge and are not designed to handle a significant volume of traffic.
The ideal scenario for the use of this plugin is to import the heightmap and road data for a given bounding box and publish it as a map for others to use.

## Development Goals
* Improve stability and performance of the mod.
* Allow configurable API endpoints to allow users to specify the endpoint that supplies the OSM data.

## Instructions to Import
Go to .terrain.party[terrain.party] and download heightmap (18km is 1:1 scale). Open the readme and copy the coordinates. 

Start a new game with the map, there should be a new road button on the right of the toolbar. Paste your coordinates into the coordinates box. 

Click on Load From terrain.party and wait for the file to download and load. 

Clean up the terrain, smoothen out the spikey bits. Then click on the "Load From overpass-api.de" button. 

It'll lag awhile while it loads the file. After it's done loading click on "Make Roads" and it should start drawing the roads.

Or you can load the map data from disk. The path is the location of your OSM file (by default you should just need to move the map file into your documents folder). Click "Load OSM From File". 

## Parameters
The scale is based on real world scale, not the bounding box, adjust this if your terrain.party heightmap is on a different scale. (Not working correctly!) The tolerance is the amount the mod will remove extra points to simplify the data. The Curve Tolerence is the leeway the mod uses in fitting curves to the map points. The tiles to boundary is the maximum number of game tiles from the middle the mod will draw on. There is a 32767 limit on the number of road segments. 


## Known issues
Scale isn't working correctly. If you have any other issues please tell me which coordinates you used!
